# PageExplorer

It is a tool launched with LabVIEW.

It provides a nicer way to explore the pages of Front Panel <b>Tab Controls</b> & Block Diagram <b>Structures</b> with ease.

This tool is invoked without any additional actions as you scroll on your Tab/Structure.

And it does not steal your window focus.

When you move on to different places, it hides from the view.

Tool window can be <b>snapped</b> to <b>Left side</b> of the monitor or the <b>Right side</b>.
Additionally user can pin it to any custom position if needed.
